# Bootcamp Homework 01 - HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## My SEO Refactor

This is an assignment to refactor HTML and CSS files to address accessibility concerns.  The code provided is a website for an imaginary marketing agency with requested changes to follow accessbility standards and improve search engine optimization using Semantic HTML and consolidated CSS selectors.  

### Homework Deliverables and Codebase Updates

* Updated HTML tags to use semantic HTML in place of div elements
* Fixed broken links from the Header nav elements
* Added alt attributes to the HTML img elements
* Consolidated the CSS selectors in the HTML file
* Ordered the CSS selectors to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements
* Added comments to the CSS file
* Created a README.md file to describe and demo the updates to the codebase
* Deployed the application to a live URL


### Struggles/Issues Encountered

While working on this homework I encountered the following obstacles:
* Uncertainty with the correct semantic HTML elements to use.  
  * Once the elements were updated, then associating them to the appropriate CSS selectors presented some challenges for me.  I found myself questioning whether the elements themselves were causing display issues in the rendered HTML/CSS.  However, I was able to identify the updates that were needed in the CSS to correctly associate the newly updated HTML elements and CSS selectors
* When I introduced the nav element, this presented issues with the display of nested list elements.  I was able to update the float on the list items in the CSS to change it from a left float to a right float and this resolved the display issue 
* Uncertainty with the information that needs to be communicated in the requested CSS comments
* Assumptions I made about which selectors could and could not be consolidated in the CSS were not always correct.  There was a lot of trial and error and eventually I ended where I did because of time constraints.  I would like to continue to understand how to streamline the CSS.
* The page is not responsive.  The images and text overlap their respective backgrounds when resized
* Writing alt text is more difficult that I thought it would be  :)
